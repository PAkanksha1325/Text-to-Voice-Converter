Hello and welcome to a simple implementation of a Text-to-Voice Converter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project uses the browser's built-in SpeechSynthesis API to convert text into speech.

## Build a Text to Speech Converter using HTML, CSS & Javascript:
A text-to-speech converter convert the text content entered by the user into speech with a click of a button. A text-to-speech converter should have a text area at the top so that the user can enter a long text to be converted into speech, followed by a button that converts the entered text into speech and plays the Listen on click to it.
